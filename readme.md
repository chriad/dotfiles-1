#Dotfiles
**Hey**, this is the dotfiles that I use.

It includes my basic vim conifg, tmux config  and bash config files.

###Dependencies
#####For bash profile
  [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/index.html) and [lynx](http://lynx.browser.org/) -- this is needed to enable reding markdown files in the terminal. *Both could be installed using 'homebrew' on mac*
    
  [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it) -- For the lovely git info display

#####For vimrc
  vundle -- will be autoinstalled first time you start vim after having this config file
