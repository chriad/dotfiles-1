#Dotfiles
**Hey**, this is the dotfiles that I use.

It includes my basic vim conifg, tmux config  and bash config files.

###Dependencies
####For bash profile
    pandoc and lynx -- this is needed to enable reding markdown files in the terminal

####For vimrc
    vundle -- will be autoinstalled first time you start vim after having this config file
